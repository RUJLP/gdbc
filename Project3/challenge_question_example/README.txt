"EI_turnout_challenge_example" has an example for what can go wrong with differential turnout 
in ER/EI.
The example assumes there are 100 people in each of 11 precincts. There are two groups of voters: White and Asian.
The example assumes all Asian voters vote for the Asian candidate and all White voters vote for the
White candidate (full racial polarization). The csv contains Shiny app input for two scenarios:
the first has 10% turnout for Asian voters and 100% for white voters, and the 2nd has 100% turnout for both.

Make sure you understand how the values in each column are computed (are there any new columns you need to add?)
and see what the outcomes look like in both scenarios in the Shiny app!
